**Meeting on 10/24/19:**
-	Added Python Project called webscraper to the github repository 
-	Also added main.py
-	Found out we need to install git so that pycharm can immediately pull and commit to the github automatically
-	Looking into apis for google, seems like a possible one was a json api
-	Found out that google limits searches in the api to 100 per day

**Research Questions:**
-	What data comes out of the Open Search API (the google search JSON API)?
-	Is it faster (or efficient) to use the API versus just pulling with the request module like we did in the homework?


**Testing from 11/13/2019**
-   Have to be careful with job hunting websites coming up
-   Linkedin does not like web-scraping it, possibly have to reconfigure parser to be more "user" like
-   As of now ShawnTestingWebsites.py searches for Microsoft jobs and gets data from the first 6 websites from google

**Testing from 11/20/2019**
-   Added basic excel output, basically takes the data from the already built dictionary but organizes it into an excel file
-   Will need more information and data to collect and organize but for now it's a very basic functioning prototype of the project
