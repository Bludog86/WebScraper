**Meeting on 10/24/19:**
-	Added Python Project called webscraper to the github repository 
-	Also added main.py
-	Found out we need to install git so that pycharm can immediately pull and commit to the github automatically
-	Looking into apis for google, seems like a possible one was a json api
-	Found out that google limits searches in the api to 100 per day

**Research Questions:**
-	What data comes out of the Open Search API (the google search JSON API)?
-	Is it faster (or efficient) to use the API versus just pulling with the request module like we did in the homework?
